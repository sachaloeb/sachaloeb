<h3 align="center">Aspiring Data Scientist | AI Engineer | Cybersecurity Specialist</h3>

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about exploring the world of **Cybersecurity**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **data science**. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge into **IoT & Robotics** to stay at the forefront of technology.

With a strong foundation in these areas, I thrive on solving complex problems and developing innovative solutions. My academic journey allows me to dive into diverse projects, and I‚Äôm currently working on **CybersecruityPersonalDashboard**, A full-stack application built with C#, ASP.NET Core, and MongoDB that helps users monitor their network activity, analyze password strength, and detect vulnerabilities to improve personal digital security.

I'm always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies, whether it's improving algorithms, optimizing data workflows, or exploring emerging fields. I believe in constant growth, and I'm committed to refining my skills to make a meaningful impact.
