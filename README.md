<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Sacha</h1>
<h3 align="center">Aspiring Data Scientist | AI Engineer | Cybersecurity Specialist</h3>

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about exploring the world of **Cybersecurity**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **data science**. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge into **IoT & Robotics** to stay at the forefront of technology.

With a strong foundation in these areas, I thrive on solving complex problems and developing innovative solutions. My academic journey allows me to dive into diverse projects, and I‚Äôm currently working on an **AI Tutor**, a system designed to provide students with personalized learning experiences. The tutor observes students‚Äô actions, supports them when they get stuck, and offers feedback and encouragement. This project involves experimenting with optimization methods to help students program robots to move as fast as possible, while also exploring solution transfer between different robots and groups in the presence of physical imperfections.

I'm always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies, whether it's improving algorithms, optimizing data workflows, or exploring emerging fields. I believe in constant growth, and I'm committed to refining my skills to make a meaningful impact.

Let‚Äôs connect! ü§ù
